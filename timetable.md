| ~ 0.5hrs | 15 mins | Was able to reuse more code from previous projects than expected |
# Add platforms (Spawning and despawning, movement)

| ~ 2.5hrs | ~3.5hrs | Tried various approaches, ultimately settled on the most straightforward by utilising multiple prefabs selected randomly. If I had stuck with this approach from the beginning, I estimate I would have roughly spent about 1.5hrs on it... |
# Scoring/Leader board/Persistence

| ~ 1.5hrs | 30mins | It was less work than expected, changing it to not use `PlayerPrefs` might take some more time though |
# Menus

| ~ 1hrs   | ~1.5hrs | While the basics were done quickly, I was unhappy with some of the decisions I made, so I decided to spend more time to make the animations and "feel" of the game more like I imagined it |
# Game management (player loses, game faster over time, `ESC` menu, etc)

| ~ 1.5hrs | ~ 1.5hrs | Some design decision were not that great, had to rework parts of the LevelManager multiple times |
# Testing

| ~ 1hr    | ~ 1.5hrs | Since I've never done testing in Unity before, I was not sure how much time it would need. However, during testing I realized that I would need to rewrite quite a lot of code in order to properly test the game. While I did not manage to thoroughly test it, I feel like I learned quite a valuable lesson, especially when designing a game and thinking about testing. |

# Extra
I got a little carried away with Post Effects and music, on which I spent roughly an additional hour...
